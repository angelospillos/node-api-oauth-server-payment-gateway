# Payment Gateway Node js OAuth2 Express js ES6 RESTful API Docker Example

Payment Gateway Node js OAuth2 Express js ES6 RESTful API Docker Example

## Description
The purpose of this template is to kick-start your node js payment gateway API. 
It implements best practices in developing RESTful APIs and Domain-Driven Design. 

Features include:
- API versioning allows you to alter behavior between different clients. ... Versioning is determined by the incoming client request, and may either be based on the request URL, or based on the request headers. There are a number of valid approaches to approaching versioning.
- A basic example of a OAuth2 server, using [oauth2-server](https://github.com/oauthjs/oauth2-server) (version 3.0.1) with the MVP model configuration.
- Use of the Hexagonal Architecture to arrange the application into logical layers, with well-defined responsibilities.
- RESTful APIs are implemented using the Express framework.
- Persistence is implemented using an in-memory repository layer. This can be substituted with any persistence technology of your choice.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Installing

Install **nodejs** and **npm** and then, simply run `npm install` and `npm start`. The server should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Authentication
API methods require
authentication by passing a bearer token (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750).
There are specific API endpoints to obtain such tokens.

## Architecture

```
/src
    /dtos
    /routes
    /services
    /repositories
    /utils
```

The source folder contains sub-folders that arrange the application into logical
layers as suggested by the
[Hexagonal Architecture](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture)
(a.k.a. the
[Onion Architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)):

-   `dtos` The dtos folder contains the dtos. A data transfer object(DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services), where each call is an expensive operation.

-   `routes:` This is the adapter layer of the Hexagonal Architecture. It adapts
the HTTP transforms the HTTP requests from the external world to the service
layer and transforms the objects returned by the service layer to HTTP
responses.

-   `services`: The service layer coordinates high-level activities such as
creation of domain objects and asking them to perform tasks requested by the
external world. It interacts with the repository layer to save and restore objects.

-   `repositories`: The repository layer is responsible for persisting domain
objects and performing CRUD operations on them. This template uses in-memory
persistence, however it can be easily replaced to use a relational or NoSQL database.

-   `utils`: The utils folder contains useful utilities and helpers.
